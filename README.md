## Project Overview
1. **Data Architecture** - Designing a data warehouse using the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layers).
2. **ETL Pipelines** - Extracting, transforming, and loading structured data.
3. **Data Modelling** - Developing interconnected fact and dimension tables, optimizing for querying and analytics.
4. **Analytics & Reporting** - Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

## Project Requirements

### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

### Specifications
- **Data Sources:** Import data from the new_yorK_subway dataset on **BigQuery**, provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality:** Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration:** Combine the data files to create a user-friendly data model for analytical queries.
- **Scope:** Focus on the latest dataset only, historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear data model documentation to support both business stakeholders and analysis teams.

## Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Multi-hop Architecture), which consists of the **bronze**, **silver**, and **gold** layers. This type of structure involves making incremental improvements to the data quality as it flows through each layer of the architecture. The setup for this project is shown below:

![Data Architecture](documents/data_architecture.png)

**Bronze Layer:** ðŸ¥‰
- The raw data is stored as-is from the source systems.
- Data is extracted from the CSV files (source object type) and entered into the SQL Server database.

**Silver Layer:** ðŸ¥ˆ
- Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes.
- Preparation phase prior to data analysis.

**Gold Layer:** ðŸ¥‡
- Holds all of the business-ready data modelled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.

## Data Flow

![Data Flow Diagram](documents/data_flow_diagram.png)
The diagram above shows the path the data takes moving from the source folder to the gold layer, where business-ready data can be used for visualization and analysis. Note that most of the rearrangement occurs between the silver and gold layers, where the data model is created through fact/dimension categorization and grouping. More on this topic below.

## Data Integration

![Data Integration](documents/data_integration.png)
The diagram above shows all the relationships discovered between the data tables. The data can be split up into 3 different groups (station, trip, and ridership).
